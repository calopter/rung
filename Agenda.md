- [ ] throw error at line 128(227) if value of data[sp] is undefined as index to memory[]
- [ ] make TOS an alias for self.data[self.sp]
- [ ] make branch where stack is allocate as vector on the heap!
- [ ] purge unwraps: pattern match to handle error cases (I0)
- [ ] comment opcodes for posterity! (Steal description from Nga.md)
- [ ] streamline `ccall` by calling `call`
